JavaScript is super-simple for beginners, even it has many WTF situations. By using shorthands, you can be more productive \u0026 you can impress your friends when coding. I want to show you some shorthands in JavaScript. They’re great. --\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cTableOfContents /\u003e\r\n\r\n## parseInt()\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet x = \"11\"\r\nconsole.log(parseInt(x)) // 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nparseInt is a function in JavaScript which is used to convert a string to a number. There is an awesome shorthand is available for parseInt. “+” is the shorthand. It’s very easy when writing a 1000-line-JS.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet y = \"100\"\r\nconsole.log(+y) // 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works with **parseFloat()** too.\r\n\r\n## Math.floor()\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet z = 14.45\r\nMath.floor(z) // 14\r\n```\r\n\r\nMath.floor is a function that is used to return the largest integer value that is less than or equal to a number. **“~~”** is the shorthand for this function. I hope you have a smile now.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(~~z) // returns 14 \r\n```\r\n\r\n## String to Boolean\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet strValue = \"true\"\r\nstrValue == \"true\" ? true : false // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am sure you will think that this is the shorthand. But there is a even short way for this too. The operator used above is called a Ternary operator. You can use this as a shorthand for an If-Else loop. The below code is a shorthand for the string to boolean conversion. It also works for number values too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet boolValue = !!strValue // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## If-Else statement\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, you can use the ternary operator as shorthand for the If-Else statement-based assignment. But when using multiline-blocks in If-Else statement, the ternary operator wants to be extended as shown below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nage \u003e 13 ? (\r\n// age is higher than 13\r\n) : (\r\n// age is not higher than 13\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## XOR gate?\r\n\r\nWe all know AND-OR gates. We use them in many places. Some of them may have heard the XOR gate. It is a mixture of AND-OR concepts. Here is the truth table for the XOR gate. for more.\r\n\r\n|A|B|A XOR B|\r\n|-|-|-------|\r\n|0|0|   0   |\r\n|0|1|   1   |\r\n|1|0|   1   |\r\n|1|1|   0   |\r\n\r\nThe XOR gate returns true if the number of inputs is odd. Sometimes we want this too. AND and OR can be accessed in JS with \u0026\u0026 and || operators respectively. But how we can access XOR?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet A = true\r\nlet B = false\r\n\r\n// these will work as XOR.\r\n(A \u0026\u0026 !B) || (!A \u0026\u0026 B) // true\r\n(A + B) \u0026\u0026 (!A + !B) // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the above code is too big and we want a lot of time to write it without any problem. The problem can be solved with just a “^”.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Shorthand\r\nA ^ B // ^ works as XOR\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above short-handed code will work. But there is a small problem with the operator, it returns a number instead of a boolean. You can simply convert it into a boolean with the shorthand #3.\r\n\r\n## string.split('')\r\n\r\nSometimes, we want to split a string into one-letter-array as shown below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet name = \"Sahithyan\" // my name\r\nlet letters = name.split('') // [S, a, h, i, t, h, y, a, n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it’s ok to write .split(‘’) one or two times in our code. But when we want to split a string into a letter array, this gets horrible. But, fortunately, there is a shorthand for the split method.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet name = \"Sahithyan\" // my name\r\nlet letters = [...name] // [S, a, h, i, t, h, y, a, n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don’t know what happens there. if you know, please tell that in the comments. But I am sure that it works.\r\n"},{"meta":{"slug":"divisibility-rules","title":"Divisibility Rules - An Explanation","description":"How much time would you need to check if a given number is divisible by 2 –15 without a computer?

Give it a try.\r\n\r\n\u003cTableOfContents /\u003e\r\n\r\nFirst of all, for those who don't know,   \r\nA divisibility rule is a shorthand way of determining whether a given integer is divisible by a fixed divisor without performing the division, usually by examining its digits. — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule)   \r\nThat being said, we are good to go.\r\n\r\n## \"The Obvious Technique\"\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the number-specific rules, I would like to explain to you an obvious technique, that can be done for any number. (I am almost sure that you know about this technique. But I am going to explain it anyway.)\r\n\r\nLet’s say that we want to check if p is divisible by q. **The divisibility of p by q is conserved if we add or subtract a multiple of q to or from p**. We can use this rule to reduce the big numbers into small ones which makes it easy for us to check if they are divisible.\r\n\r\n\u003cimg alt=\"Checking if 3056 is divisible by 27\" src=\"/post__images/divisibility-rules/The Obvious Rule.png\" /\u003e\r\n\r\nFor example, let’s say that we want to check if 3056 is divisible by 27. We can do that using the above-mentioned technique. I will subtract 2700 and then 297 (which are both divisible by 27), from 3056.\r\n\r\nAs it comes down to 69, which is not divisible by 27, 3056 is also not divisible by 27.\r\n\r\nIt can be long and hard most of the time. But in some cases, it can be easy and fast (for example, checking if 5430 is divisible by 27). We will use this process in some (if not all) rules in this story. I will refer to this technique as the _Basic Technique_ in this story.\r\n\r\nNote: **iff** means if and only if, for example, _A iff B_ means, A is true if and only if B is true.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that I am talking about divisibility rules in the “Decimal Number System”. You can find divisibility rules in other number systems with the ideas gathered from here. _If you think of yourself as a nerd, try to find divisibility rules in binary and octal number systems_.\r\n\r\n## Elementary Rules\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the main rules, I want to explain some of the elementary rules that everyone knows. _These are sorted from easy to hard_.\r\n\r\n### 10\r\n\r\n**Check if the last number is 0**. I know that I shouldn’t include it here. But whatever. And as it is so obvious, let’s move on.\r\n\r\n### 2, 5 (n)\r\n\r\n**Check if the last digit is divisible by n**. I would like to explain why. You can skip the next paragraph if you want.\r\n\r\nTake a number in the format of _ABC (0 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 9)_ (It doesn’t have to be a 3-digit number; it can any number of digits).\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that _ABC_ can be written as _AB0 + 00C_. We know that _AB0_ is divisible by 2, 5, 10 (because the last digit is 0). As mentioned in the _Basic Technique_, _00C_’s divisibility of 2 is the same as _ABC_’s. So checking the last digit is enough.\r\n\r\nI also want to say that 2, 5, 10 are the only numbers that have the “_check the last digit_” divisibility-rule type.\r\n\r\n### 3, 9 (n)\r\n\r\nThese two are also easy, but you can’t tell it instantly like 2 or 5. **Add up the digits of the number, and see if it is divisible by n**. By the way, I want to note that these are the only numbers that have the “_Add up the digits_” divisibility-rule type.\r\n\r\nFor example, 12049’s digits add up to 16. So 12049 is not divisible by both 3 and 9 as 16 is not divisible by both 3 and 9.\r\n\r\n### 4, 8\r\n\r\n4 and 8’s divisibility rules are like 2's. But instead of checking the last digit, you have to **check the last 2 digits for 4 and check the last 3 digits for 8**.\r\n\r\n### 6\r\n\r\n**A number is divisible by 6 iff the number is divisible by both 2 and 3**. So do the rules for 2 and 3 on the number, and if both ended up true, then the number is divisible by 6.\r\n\r\n## The Unknown Rules\r\n\r\nAs you are clear about the basic rules for divisibility testing, we can start looking at some lesser known rules.\r\n\r\nI am not going to explain the general cases anymore. Because it would be so hard for both you and me. I will just explain with an example.\r\n\r\n### 7, 11, 13, 17 (n)\r\n\r\nThese numbers share the same kind of pattern in their divisibility rules, so I grouped them.\r\n\r\nI am going to show you how to check if 54012 is divisible by 7. First, observe this example. Then choose a different number and see if you really understood it.\r\n\r\n\u003cimg alt=\"Checking if 54012 is divisible by 7\" src=\"/post__images/divisibility-rules/Divisibility Rule - 7.svg\" /\u003e\r\n\r\n54012, so the last number is 2 and the other numbers are 5401. So I am going to subtract 4 (2 times the last number) from 5401, and I get 5397.\r\nAs I am not sure if it is divisible by 7, I am going to do it again. I am repeating this process until I get 41 which I know is not divisible by 7. So we can conclude that 54012 is not divisible by 7.\r\n\r\nI will refer to this recursive technique as “_Recursive Technique_”.\r\n\r\nTo check if a number is divisible by 11 or 13 or 17, you have to follow the same process. But instead of multiplying the last digit with 2, you have to multiply it with a different number, based on the below table.\r\n\r\n|n|multiply with|\r\n|--|-------------|\r\n| 7|      2      |\r\n|11|      1      |\r\n|13|      9      |\r\n|17|      5      |\r\n\r\nTo check if a number is divisible by 11 or 13 or 17, you have to follow the same process. But instead of multiplying the last digit with 2, you have to multiply it with a different number, based on the below table.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know about the relation between these numbers, just keep reading.\r\n\r\n### For all the other numbers\r\n\r\nThis may sound stupid to you. But wait, I am not saying that every other number has ONE divisibility rule. I am just saying that there are some techniques that you can use to find a number’s divisibility rule.\r\n\r\nFirst, you have to **see if it is a power of 2 or 5**. Let’s say that the number is nth power of 2 or 5. Then check for the last n digits. That’s enough. This is why I told you to check for the last 2 digits for 4 (2²) and 3 digits for 8 (2³).\r\nThe explanation for this is quite easy. 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, so 10’s nth power is divisible by the nth power of both 2 and 5. I hope you can finish the explanation on your own. [Refer to the 2, 5’s explanation]\r\nDon’t be sad if it is not a power of 2 or 5, we have more techniques.\r\n\r\nNext, **Check if any of its multiples have 1 as the last digit**. For example, 7 has 21, 9 has 81, 11 has 11, 13 has 91, 17 has 51, and so on. If it does, you can do the _Recursive Technique_. But you have to multiply the last digit with a number. How do you select the number? I hope the image below gives you an idea.\r\n\r\n| n|    |multiply with|\r\n|--|----|-------------|\r\n| 7|2*1*|      2      |\r\n|11|1*1*|      1      |\r\n|13|9*1*|      9      |\r\n|17|5*1*|      5      |\r\n\r\nYou have to multiply by the number you get after crossing out the last “1”. But why?, we are just doing the _Basic Technique_. Think about it. If you couldn’t find out, let me know somehow (yeah, I am lazy to implement the comments section here), I will try to add it.\r\n\r\nAnd I have one more trick which works for non-primes. Let’s say we want to check if p is divisible by q. We can do that by checking if _p_ is divisible by all (or some) of the factors of _q_. In most cases, it can be hard to do, but sometimes it can be helpful.\r\n\r\nFor example, 6, we check for its factors (2, 3). It’s so easy in the case of 6 because we have to check for only 2 and 3. But what about other numbers that have many factors? For those numbers, there is an easy way too. Instead of checking for all of the factors of _q_, you can just check it for 2 numbers. But how would you select those two numbers? **Those two numbers must fulfill these 2 conditions**.\r\n1. Their [greatest common divisor (GCD)]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) is 1. \r\n2. when multiplied, they give _q_.\r\n\r\nWith these tricks and techniques, you can check if a number is divisible by any number between 2 and 28 in 10 seconds. You can go for other numbers too, but it may take longer. But as you use them again and again, you will slowly become fast.\r\n\r\nPS: The _Basic Technique_ and the _Recursive Technique_ are not mathematical terms. I am just naming them just for the sake of reference."},{"meta":{"slug":"introduction-to-my-blog","title":"Introduction To My Blog","description":"Creating my own blogging website. \"Why?\" \u0026 \"How?\" answered.","dateCreated":1614347284357,"tags":[],"estReadTime":2},"content":"\r\nHello people! Welcome to my blog!. This is my blog, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and a [few other open source packages](#packages-i-used).\r\n\r\nAfter thinking of starting a blog for about a week, I finally decided to start developing it. And as the first blog post, I wanted to write about how I created this blog. I hope it's helpful.\r\n\r\n\u003cTableOfContents /\u003e\r\n\r\n## First, WHY?\r\n\r\nI, occasionally, write to share my insights. In the past, I used [Medium](https://www.medium.com), a famous writing site, to write my insights as articles. But I didn't like their *Only 2 free stories per month* plan. Hence, I started looking for alternatives. And nothing seemed suitable for me.\r\n\r\nSo I decided that I should create one on my own for me. Because, by creating my own website, I can be my own boss. I can style and structure this my blog, however I want. Medium can't give me that power. That's why I decided to reinventing the wheel.\r\n\r\n## How I built it?\r\n\r\nThis blog was initiated with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), The React Framework for Production.\r\n\r\nI wanted to write using Markdown as it's easy to use. As I was searching for a markdown-to-html compiler, I came across [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). MDX is Markdown and JSX combined. It seemed more powerful. Hence, I decided to use it.\r\n\r\nAt first, I went with Server-side rendering. But now, I changed to static build.\r\n\r\n## Packages I used\r\n\r\nIn this section, I mentioned all the packages, that I installed for a specific use. (That means, I left the framework's dependencies)\r\n\r\n- [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) - To compile the MDX files into JS objects\r\n- [next-mdx-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote) - To compile MDX into html \r\n- [mdx-prism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-prism) - To use prism (for syntax highlighting) with MDX"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts","query":{},"buildId":"N9rjHLD-Qte1aoGHqo6Q0","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-ff94e68042added27a93.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-a352acdd92c7df893dce.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-50bee04d1dc61f8adf5b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.0a9f20eff0752717cd72.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.e24a78adf84480952f1e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-5aab34ad73fa33d03c17.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/0595ac49cd883455adcb9bfdead508b8159b1d8e.85662a779f81c50e12fe.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/posts-92f3b9b10e2de287ecb9.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/N9rjHLD-Qte1aoGHqo6Q0/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/N9rjHLD-Qte1aoGHqo6Q0/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
