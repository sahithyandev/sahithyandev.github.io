For the majority of people, in most cases, that is more than enough.</p><p>But, as a Math lover, sometimes, I ran into some problems which can be solved easily on a computer (or a calculator), but still not included in any of these existing calculator apps.
For example, prime factorization. It&#x27;s easy for a small set of numbers (like 500, 360). But on a computer, it can be done in seconds (or even milliseconds). But I have never seen that functionality included in a calculator. And this is only one example. This felt like a gap for me. That’s why I decided to develop a calculator app that has these extra functions. That’s what XCalc is.</p><p>Note that I only added the functions that are not available in those existing calculator apps. And I intentionally left out the functions like log or sqrt, because they are already available on the pre-installed calculator apps.</p><p>So, what functions did I add? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://x-calc.vercel.app/help">Here</a> is a list. </p><ul><li>is-prime: checks if a number is a prime number</li><li>factors: finds all the factors of a number</li><li>lcm: finds the least common multiple of a list a numbers</li><li>gcd: finds the greatest common divisor of a list a numbers</li><li>factorial: finds the n-th factorial</li><li>ratio: finds the minimum ratio in a list of numbers</li><li>nck: finds the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">binomial coefficient</a> denoted by (n k)</li><li>prime-factorize: finds the prime factorization of the given number</li></ul><p>If you like the idea of XCalc, you can try it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bit.ly/xcalc-web">here</a>.

But I don&#x27;t know any of them before. And I didn&#x27;t want to learn them. Fortunately, I came to know about AssemblyScript. AssemblyScript is a typescript-based language which compiles to WASM. With the familiar syntax, AssemblyScript appeared to be the best option for me. So, I chose to use it.</p><p>Getting started with AssemblyScript was a little hard for me. But, maybe, that would have been easy if I read the documentation clearly.</p><h2 class="linkable-head_linkable__2KbTa" id="" data-is-linkable="true"><span class="linkable--heading-text">Conclusion</span></h2><p>Overall, working on XCalc was a really great experience for me. There was a lot of fun and learning.</p><p>Here is the main thing I learnt while building XCalc.</p><p><strong>Read the documentation clearly</strong>. This is one of my bad habits. I don&#x27;t read the documentation completely. I always miss to notice something in every documentation I read. Because of that, I have even spent a significant amount of time, trying to find how to do a specific thing (which is already explained in the documentation). So, when you are reading a documentation for something, make sure to read it through. Don’t skip anything. When you get stuck with an error or bug, before starting searching it on google, make sure to check the official documentation.</p><p>If you have read this much, Thank you for your time.

They provide us with basic and some advanced operations. For the majority of people, in most cases, that is more than enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, as a Math lover, sometimes, I ran into some problems which can be solved easily on a computer (or a calculator), but still not included in any of these existing calculator apps.\nFor example, prime factorization. It\u0026#x27;s easy for a small set of numbers (like 500, 360). But on a computer, it can be done in seconds (or even milliseconds). But I have never seen that functionality included in a calculator. And this is only one example. This felt like a gap for me. That’s why I decided to develop a calculator app that has these extra functions. That’s what XCalc is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that I only added the functions that are not available in those existing calculator apps. And I intentionally left out the functions like log or sqrt, because they are already available on the pre-installed calculator apps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what functions did I add? \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://x-calc.vercel.app/help\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e is a list. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eis-prime: checks if a number is a prime number\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efactors: finds all the factors of a number\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003elcm: finds the least common multiple of a list a numbers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003egcd: finds the greatest common divisor of a list a numbers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efactorial: finds the n-th factorial\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eratio: finds the minimum ratio in a list of numbers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003enck: finds the \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient\"\u003ebinomial coefficient\u003c/a\u003e denoted by (n k)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eprime-factorize: finds the prime factorization of the given number\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you like the idea of XCalc, you can try it \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://bit.ly/xcalc-web\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.

The important one is \u003cstrong\u003eprevention of many little bugs\u003c/strong\u003e. As TypeScript allows me to set types to everything, now I don’t have to be too concerned about the code now.

After about 3 months, I came back. I decided to rewrite the whole app with new (better) technologies. As a part of that, I redesigned the UI.

I wanted to write all the code by myself. The state of the app (the input), the dynamic UI rendering were all done by the code I wrote. At first, It worked without any problems.

This is where the layout and paint are done. This is where the user events get processed. And also, this is where, the javascript runs. Which means, long-running JavaScript will block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page (== bad user experience)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is where web workers come into play. Web workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts on background threads.
