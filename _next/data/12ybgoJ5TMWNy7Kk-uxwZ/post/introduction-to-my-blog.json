Welcome to my blog!. This is my blog, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and a [few other open source packages](#packages-i-used).\r\n\r\nAfter thinking of starting a blog for about a week, I finally decided to start developing it. And as the first blog post, I wanted to write about how I created this blog. I hope it's helpful.\r\n\r\n<TableOfContents source={sourceContent} />\r\n\r\n## First, WHY?\r\n\r\nI, occasionally, write to share my insights. In the past, I used [Medium](https://www.medium.com), a famous writing site, to write my insights as articles. But I didn't like their *Only 2 free stories per month* plan. Hence, I started looking for alternatives. And nothing seemed suitable for me.\r\n\r\nSo I decided that I should create one on my own for me. Because, by creating my own website, I can be my own boss. I can style and structure this my blog, however I want. Medium can't give me that power.

As I was searching for a markdown-to-html compiler, I came across [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). MDX is Markdown and JSX combined. It seemed more powerful.
