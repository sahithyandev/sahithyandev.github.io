They provide us with basic and some advanced operations. For the majority of people, in most cases, that is more than enough.\n\nBut, as a Math lover, sometimes, I ran into some problems which can be solved easily on a computer (or a calculator), but still not included in any of these existing calculator apps.\nFor example, prime factorization. It's easy for a small set of numbers (like 500, 360). But on a computer, it can be done in seconds (or even milliseconds). But I have never seen that functionality included in a calculator. And this is only one example. This felt like a gap for me. That’s why I decided to develop a calculator app that has these extra functions. That’s what XCalc is.\n\n\nNote that I only added the functions that are not available in those existing calculator apps. And I intentionally left out the functions like log or sqrt, because they are already available on the pre-installed calculator apps.\n\nSo, what functions did I add? [Here](https://x-calc.vercel.app/help) is a list. \n - is-prime: checks if a number is a prime number\n - factors: finds all the factors of a number\n - lcm: finds the least common multiple of a list a numbers\n - gcd: finds the greatest common divisor of a list a numbers\n - factorial: finds the n-th factorial\n - ratio: finds the minimum ratio in a list of numbers\n - nck: finds the [binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) denoted by (n k)\n - prime-factorize: finds the prime factorization of the given number\n\nIf you like the idea of XCalc, you can try it [here](https://bit.ly/xcalc-web). From the website, XCalc can be installed to your devices (I don’t know if it is supported on all operating systems and all browsers).\nAnd [XCalc is available on Google Play Store](https://bit.ly/xcalc-app) as well.\n\nIf you are interested to see how XCalc is coded, Good news, XCalc is [open-sourced](http://github.com/sahithyandev/xcalc). If you find it hard to understand the code, let me know about that.\n\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>How I built it</linkableH2>\n\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>\n\t<CustomLink href=\"https://typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</CustomLink>\n</linkableH3>\n\nTypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional strict typing to the language. It compiles to JavaScript.\n\nI decided to bring it into the code base mainly for two reasons. The important one is **prevention of many little bugs**. As TypeScript allows me to set types to everything, now I don’t have to be too concerned about the code now. I can be confident (in most cases) that I am not gonna run into any runtime errors.\nAnd the next one is, **reduced mind-overloading**. Which means, now, I don’t have to memorize the function parameter types and object structures. My IDE's intellisense takes care of that.\n\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>UI Design</linkableH3>\n\nIt's highly recommended to design the UI before coding it. [Here's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyAsNw7XZ1c). \n\nHence, I decided to design the whole UI first (or at least try). I opened up [Figma](https://figma.com) and gave it a try. Here's what I designed.\n\n<img alt=\"XCalc Old UI design\" src=\"/post__images/building-xcalc/xcalc-old-design.jpg\" />\n\nI went with it. Because, the important thing about XCalc is its functionality; not the UI.\n\n\nWhen I made XCalc completely working, (as always) I stopped working on it. After about 3 months, I came back. I decided to rewrite the whole app with new (better) technologies. As a part of that, I redesigned the UI. It turned out to be pretty great.\n\n<img alt=\"XCalc New UI design\" src=\"/post__images/building-xcalc/xcalc-new-design.png\" />\n\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}><CustomLink href=\"https://reactjs.org\">React</CustomLink></linkableH3>\nWhen I first started developing XCalc, I didn't use any front-end libraries. I wanted to write all the code by myself. The state of the app (the input), the dynamic UI rendering were all done by the code I wrote. At first, It worked without any problems.  But when I came back after 3 months, I understood none of it. That's when I realized that I should have used a front-end library.\n\nWhen I started rewriting the app, I chose to go with React, which is my favorite front-end library.\n\nTo be honest, the React code is not that good either. But it is a lot more readable than my code.\n\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}><CustomLink href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</CustomLink></linkableH3>\nSass is a pre-compiler for CSS. It provides some additional functionalities which results in a better developer experience. That’s the one and only reason I decided to use Sass.\n\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>Off-thread evaluations</linkableH3>\nBy default, the browser uses a single thread (\"main thread\") to run all the processes of a website. This is where the layout and paint are done. This is where the user events get processed. And also, this is where, the javascript runs. Which means, long-running JavaScript will block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page (== bad user experience)\n\nThis is where web workers come into play. Web workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts on background threads. This will make sure the main thread is free from getting stuck. [Learn more about web workers on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).\n\nXCalc never blocked the main thread (on my laptop and my phone), it worked without any problems. There were no performance issues at all. But, on the low-end phones, performance issues might rise.\n\nAnd, it's a good idea to use the main thread only for UI work. That's why the main thread is called \"UI thread\" on other platforms. So, I moved the evaluations of the input to a web worker. \n\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>Offline support</linkableH3>\n<BlockQuote citationText=\"Google Developers Blog\" citationLink=\"https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker#what_is_a_service_worker\">\nService workers are a special type of web workers. A service worker is essentially a JavaScript file that runs separately from the main browser thread (or UI thread), intercepting network requests, caching or retrieving resources from the cache, and delivering push messages.\n</BlockQuote>\n\nWith the use of service workers, web apps can now deliver a custom offline experience. For example, YouTube and Spotify have a custom offline page. While searching for more examples, I found this [awesome sudoku game](https://sudoku.jull.dev/), which is completely available for offline use.\n\nLike that sudoku game, XCalc doesn’t need an active internet connection to work. So, as you may guess, I wanted to make XCalc completely offline, just like that game. So, I added a service worker to do that. It pre-caches all the required resources. After that, the resources will be loaded from the cache.\n\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>\n<CustomLink href=\"https://webassembly.org\">\n\t\tWebAssembly\n\t </CustomLink>{\" \"}\n\t(<CustomLink href=\"https://www.assemblyscript.org\">AssemblyScript</CustomLink>)\n</linkableH3>\n\nWebAssembly (WASM, in short) is a new type of code that can be run inside web browsers. It is a low-level assembly-like language which runs with near-native performance.\nBut, **keep in mind that WASM is not intended to replace JS, and it won’t**.\n\nWebAssembly first appeared in 2017, but I came to know about it recently. I decided to use it in XCalc. I know that WebAssembly wasn't meant to be used on a calculator app like XCalc, But I chose to use it just for the sake of learning.\n\nC, C++, Rust can be compiled to WASM. But I don't know any of them before. And I didn't want to learn them. Fortunately, I came to know about AssemblyScript. AssemblyScript is a typescript-based language which compiles to WASM. With the familiar syntax, AssemblyScript appeared to be the best option for me. So, I chose to use it.\n\nGetting started with AssemblyScript was a little hard for me. But, maybe, that would have been easy if I read the documentation clearly.\n\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>Conclusion</linkableH2>\nOverall, working on XCalc was a really great experience for me. There was a lot of fun and learning.\n\nHere is the main thing I learnt while building XCalc.\n\n**Read the documentation clearly**. This is one of my bad habits. I don't read the documentation completely. I always miss to notice something in every documentation I read. Because of that, I have even spent a significant amount of time, trying to find how to do a specific thing (which is already explained in the documentation). So, when you are reading a documentation for something, make sure to read it through. Don’t skip anything. When you get stuck with an error or bug, before starting searching it on google, make sure to check the official documentation.\n\nIf you have read this much, Thank you for your time.

There is an awesome shorthand is available for parseInt. “+” is the shorthand. It’s very easy when writing a 1000-line-JS.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet y = \"100\"\r\nconsole.log(+y) // 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works with **parseFloat()** too.\r\n\r\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>Math.floor()</linkableH2>\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet z = 14.45\r\nMath.floor(z) // 14\r\n```\r\n\r\nMath.floor is a function that is used to return the largest integer value that is less than or equal to a number. **“~~”** is the shorthand for this function. I hope you have a smile now.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(~~z) // returns 14 \r\n```\r\n\r\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>String to Boolean</linkableH2>\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet strValue = \"true\"\r\nstrValue == \"true\" ? true : false // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am sure you will think that this is the shorthand. But there is a even short way for this too. The operator used above is called a Ternary operator. You can use this as a shorthand for an If-Else loop. The below code is a shorthand for the string to boolean conversion. It also works for number values too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet boolValue = !!strValue // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>If-Else statement</linkableH2>\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, you can use the ternary operator as shorthand for the If-Else statement-based assignment. But when using multiline-blocks in If-Else statement, the ternary operator wants to be extended as shown below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nage > 13 ? (\r\n// age is higher than 13\r\n) : (\r\n// age is not higher than 13\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>XOR gate?</linkableH2>\r\n\r\nWe all know AND-OR gates. We use them in many places. Some of them may have heard the XOR gate. It is a mixture of AND-OR concepts. Here is the truth table for the XOR gate. for more.\r\n\r\n|A|B|A XOR B|\r\n|-|-|-------|\r\n|0|0|   0   |\r\n|0|1|   1   |\r\n|1|0|   1   |\r\n|1|1|   0   |\r\n\r\nThe XOR gate returns true if the number of inputs is odd. Sometimes we want this too. AND and OR can be accessed in JS with && and || operators respectively. But how we can access XOR?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet A = true\r\nlet B = false\r\n\r\n// these will work as XOR.\r\n(A && !B) || (!A && B) // true\r\n(A + B) && (!A + !B) // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the above code is too big and we want a lot of time to write it without any problem. The problem can be solved with just a “^”.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Shorthand\r\nA ^ B // ^ works as XOR\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above short-handed code will work. But there is a small problem with the operator, it returns a number instead of a boolean. You can simply convert it into a boolean with the shorthand #3.\r\n\r\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>string.split('')</linkableH2>\r\n\r\nSometimes, we want to split a string into one-letter-array as shown below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet name = \"Sahithyan\" // my name\r\nlet letters = name.split('') // [S, a, h, i, t, h, y, a, n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it’s ok to write .split(‘’) one or two times in our code. But when we want to split a string into a letter array, this gets horrible. But, fortunately, there is a shorthand for the split method.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet name = \"Sahithyan\" // my name\r\nlet letters = [...name] // [S, a, h, i, t, h, y, a, n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don’t know what happens there. if you know, please tell that in the comments. But I am sure that it works.\r\n"},{"meta":{"title":"Divisibility Rules - An Explanation","description":"How much time would you need to check if a given number is divisible by 2 –15 without a computer?

Give it a try.\r\n\r\n<TableOfContents source={sourceContent} slug={slug} />\r\n\r\nFirst of all, for those who don't know,   \r\nA divisibility rule is a shorthand way of determining whether a given integer is divisible by a fixed divisor without performing the division, usually by examining its digits. — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule)   \r\nThat being said, we are good to go.\r\n\r\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>\"The Obvious Technique\"</linkableH2>\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the number-specific rules, I would like to explain to you an obvious technique, that can be done for any number. (I am almost sure that you know about this technique. But I am going to explain it anyway.)\r\n\r\nLet’s say that we want to check if p is divisible by q. **The divisibility of p by q is conserved if we add or subtract a multiple of q to or from p**. We can use this rule to reduce the big numbers into small ones which makes it easy for us to check if they are divisible.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Checking if 3056 is divisible by 27\" src=\"/post__images/divisibility-rules/The Obvious Rule.png\" />\r\n\r\nFor example, let’s say that we want to check if 3056 is divisible by 27. We can do that using the above-mentioned technique. I will subtract 2700 and then 297 (which are both divisible by 27), from 3056.\r\n\r\nAs it comes down to 69, which is not divisible by 27, 3056 is also not divisible by 27.\r\n\r\nIt can be long and hard most of the time. But in some cases, it can be easy and fast (for example, checking if 5430 is divisible by 27). We will use this process in some (if not all) rules in this story. I will refer to this technique as the _Basic Technique_ in this story.\r\n\r\nNote: **iff** means if and only if, for example, _A iff B_ means, A is true if and only if B is true.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that I am talking about divisibility rules in the “Decimal Number System”. You can find divisibility rules in other number systems with the ideas gathered from here. _If you think of yourself as a nerd, try to find divisibility rules in binary and octal number systems_.\r\n\r\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>Elementary Rules</linkableH2>\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the main rules, I want to explain some of the elementary rules that everyone knows. _These are sorted from easy to hard_.\r\n\r\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>10</linkableH3>\r\n\r\n**Check if the last number is 0**. I know that I shouldn’t include it here. But whatever. And as it is so obvious, let’s move on.\r\n\r\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>2, 5 (n)</linkableH3>\r\n\r\n**Check if the last digit is divisible by n**. I would like to explain why. You can skip the next paragraph if you want.\r\n\r\nTake a number in the format of _ABC (0 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 9)_ (It doesn’t have to be a 3-digit number; it can any number of digits).\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that _ABC_ can be written as _AB0 + 00C_. We know that _AB0_ is divisible by 2, 5, 10 (because the last digit is 0). As mentioned in the _Basic Technique_, _00C_’s divisibility of 2 is the same as _ABC_’s. So checking the last digit is enough.\r\n\r\nI also want to say that 2, 5, 10 are the only numbers that have the “_check the last digit_” divisibility-rule type.\r\n\r\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>3, 9 (n)</linkableH3>\r\n\r\nThese two are also easy, but you can’t tell it instantly like 2 or 5. **Add up the digits of the number, and see if it is divisible by n**. By the way, I want to note that these are the only numbers that have the “_Add up the digits_” divisibility-rule type.\r\n\r\nFor example, 12049’s digits add up to 16. So 12049 is not divisible by both 3 and 9 as 16 is not divisible by both 3 and 9.\r\n\r\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>4, 8</linkableH3>\r\n\r\n4 and 8’s divisibility rules are like 2's. But instead of checking the last digit, you have to **check the last 2 digits for 4 and check the last 3 digits for 8**.\r\n\r\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>6</linkableH3>\r\n\r\n**A number is divisible by 6 iff the number is divisible by both 2 and 3**. So do the rules for 2 and 3 on the number, and if both ended up true, then the number is divisible by 6.\r\n\r\n<linkableH2 slug={slug}>The Unknown Rules</linkableH2>\r\n\r\nAs you are clear about the basic rules for divisibility testing, we can start looking at some lesser known rules.\r\n\r\nI am not going to explain the general cases anymore. Because it would be so hard for both you and me. I will just explain with an example.\r\n\r\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>7, 11, 13, 17 (n)</linkableH3>\r\n\r\nThese numbers share the same kind of pattern in their divisibility rules, so I grouped them.\r\n\r\nI am going to show you how to check if 54012 is divisible by 7. First, observe this example. Then choose a different number and see if you really understood it.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Checking if 54012 is divisible by 7\" src=\"/post__images/divisibility-rules/Divisibility Rule - 7.svg\" />\r\n\r\n54012, so the last number is 2 and the other numbers are 5401. So I am going to subtract 4 (2 times the last number) from 5401, and I get 5397.\r\nAs I am not sure if it is divisible by 7, I am going to do it again. I am repeating this process until I get 41 which I know is not divisible by 7. So we can conclude that 54012 is not divisible by 7.\r\n\r\nI will refer to this recursive technique as “_Recursive Technique_”.\r\n\r\nTo check if a number is divisible by 11 or 13 or 17, you have to follow the same process. But instead of multiplying the last digit with 2, you have to multiply it with a different number, based on the below table.\r\n\r\n|n|multiply with|\r\n|--|-------------|\r\n| 7|      2      |\r\n|11|      1      |\r\n|13|      9      |\r\n|17|      5      |\r\n\r\nTo check if a number is divisible by 11 or 13 or 17, you have to follow the same process. But instead of multiplying the last digit with 2, you have to multiply it with a different number, based on the below table.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know about the relation between these numbers, just keep reading.\r\n\r\n<linkableH3 slug={slug}>For all the other numbers</linkableH3>\r\n\r\nThis may sound stupid to you. But wait, I am not saying that every other number has ONE divisibility rule. I am just saying that there are some techniques that you can use to find a number’s divisibility rule.\r\n\r\nFirst, you have to **see if it is a power of 2 or 5**. Let’s say that the number is nth power of 2 or 5. Then check for the last n digits. That’s enough. This is why I told you to check for the last 2 digits for 4 (2²) and 3 digits for 8 (2³).\r\nThe explanation for this is quite easy. 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, so 10’s nth power is divisible by the nth power of both 2 and 5. I hope you can finish the explanation on your own. [Refer to the 2, 5’s explanation]\r\nDon’t be sad if it is not a power of 2 or 5, we have more techniques.\r\n\r\nNext, **Check if any of its multiples have 1 as the last digit**. For example, 7 has 21, 9 has 81, 11 has 11, 13 has 91, 17 has 51, and so on. If it does, you can do the _Recursive Technique_. But you have to multiply the last digit with a number. How do you select the number? I hope the image below gives you an idea.\r\n\r\n| n|    |multiply with|\r\n|--|----|-------------|\r\n| 7|2*1*|      2      |\r\n|11|1*1*|      1      |\r\n|13|9*1*|      9      |\r\n|17|5*1*|      5      |\r\n\r\nYou have to multiply by the number you get after crossing out the last “1”. But why?, we are just doing the _Basic Technique_. Think about it. If you couldn’t find out, let me know somehow (yeah, I am lazy to implement the comments section here), I will try to add it.\r\n\r\nAnd I have one more trick which works for non-primes. Let’s say we want to check if p is divisible by q. We can do that by checking if _p_ is divisible by all (or some) of the factors of _q_. In most cases, it can be hard to do, but sometimes it can be helpful.\r\n\r\nFor example, 6, we check for its factors (2, 3). It’s so easy in the case of 6 because we have to check for only 2 and 3. But what about other numbers that have many factors? For those numbers, there is an easy way too. Instead of checking for all of the factors of _q_, you can just check it for 2 numbers. But how would you select those two numbers? **Those two numbers must fulfil these 2 conditions**.\r\n1. Their [greatest common divisor (GCD)]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) is 1. \r\n2. when multiplied, they give _q_.\r\n\r\nWith these tricks and techniques, you can check if a number is divisible by any number between 2 and 28 in 10 seconds. You can go for other numbers too, but it may take longer. But as you use them again and again, you will slowly become fast.\r\n\r\nPS: The _Basic Technique_ and the _Recursive Technique_ are not mathematical terms. I am just naming them just for the sake of reference."},{"meta":{"title":"Introduction To My Blog","description":"Creating my own blogging website. \"Why?\" & \"How?\" answered.","dateCreated":1614347284357,"tags":[],"estReadTime":2,"lastModifiedTime":1625231301320,"slug":"introduction-to-my-blog"},"content":"\r\nHello people!
