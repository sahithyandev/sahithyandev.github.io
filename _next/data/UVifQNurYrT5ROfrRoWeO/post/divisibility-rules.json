But what about other numbers that have many factors? For those numbers, there is an easy way too. Instead of checking for all of the factors of q, you can just check it for 2 numbers. But how would you select those two numbers? <strong>Those two numbers must fulfill these 2 conditions. (1) Their <a class=\"custom-link_external__3tl0K\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)\">greatest common divisor (GCD)</a> is 1, (2) when multiplied, they give q</strong>.</p><p>With these tricks and techniques, you can check if a number is divisible by any number between 2 and 28 in 10 seconds. You can go for other numbers too, but it may take longer. But as you use them again and again, you will slowly become fast.</p><p>PS: The <em>Basic Technique</em> and the <em>Recursive Technique</em> are not mathematical terms.
